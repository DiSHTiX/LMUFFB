**Task: Fix Violent Shaking at Stop & Missing Road Texture on DLC Cars**

**Reference Documents:**
*   `docs\dev_docs\Fix Violent Shaking when Stopping and no road textures.md` (Contains the detailed analysis and code snippets)
*   `src/FFBEngine.h`
*   `tests/test_ffb_engine.cpp`

**Context:**
Users have reported two distinct issues:
1.  **Violent Shaking at Stop:** The steering wheel shakes violently when the car is stationary (e.g., in pits). This is caused by engine idle vibrations and sensor noise being amplified by the FFB engine when there is no forward motion to mask them.
2.  **No Road Texture (DLC Cars):** On encrypted cars (like the Porsche 911 GT3 R), the game blocks `mVerticalTireDeflection` telemetry (returns 0.0). This causes the Road Texture effect to be silent, as it relies on deflection deltas.

**Implementation Requirements:**

1.  **Modify `src/FFBEngine.h`**:
    *   **Add Member**: Add `double m_prev_vert_accel = 0.0;` to the class to track vertical acceleration history.
    *   **Implement Stationary Gate**:
        *   Calculate a `speed_gate` scalar based on `car_speed` (absolute longitudinal velocity).
        *   Logic: Ramp from 0.0 (at < 0.5 m/s) to 1.0 (at > 2.0 m/s).
        *   Apply this `speed_gate` multiplier to the final amplitude of: **Road Texture**, **ABS Pulse**, **Lockup Vibration**, and **Suspension Bottoming**.
    *   **Implement Road Texture Fallback**:
        *   Inside the Road Texture block, detect if `mVerticalTireDeflection` is "dead" (deltas are near zero) while the car is moving (`car_speed > 5.0`).
        *   If dead, switch to using **Vertical Acceleration** (`mLocalAccel.y`) as the source.
        *   Calculate `delta_accel = current_accel_y - m_prev_vert_accel`.
        *   Scale: `road_noise_val = delta_accel * 0.05 * 50.0` (Empirical scaling to match deflection magnitude).
        *   Update `m_prev_vert_accel` at the end of the block.
    *   **Update Warnings**: Change the `mTireLoad` missing warning text to explicitly mention: `"(Likely Encrypted/DLC Content). Using Kinematic Fallback."`

2.  **Modify `tests/test_ffb_engine.cpp`**:
    *   Add a new test case `test_stationary_gate()`.
    *   Simulate a stationary car (`Speed = 0.0`) with noisy suspension inputs (`mVerticalTireDeflection` changing).
    *   Assert that the calculated `road_noise` or total force is effectively **0.0** (suppressed by the gate).

3.  **Documentation**:
    *   Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a new version entry (e.g., v0.6.21) documenting these fixes.
    *   Increment the version number in the `VERSION` file.

**Deliverables:**
*   Modified `src/FFBEngine.h`
*   Modified `tests/test_ffb_engine.cpp`
*   Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION`

**Check-list for completion:**
- [ ] `FFBEngine.h`: `speed_gate` implemented and applied to vibration effects.
- [ ] `FFBEngine.h`: Road Texture fallback to `mLocalAccel.y` implemented.
- [ ] `FFBEngine.h`: Warning message updated.
- [ ] `test_ffb_engine.cpp`: `test_stationary_gate` added and passing.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION` updated.
- [ ] Code compiles successfully.
