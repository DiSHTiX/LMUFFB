**Task: Explicitly Handle DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO (0x80040205)**

**Reference Documents:**
*   `src\DirectInputFFB.cpp`

**Context:**
Users are reporting "Unknown Error (0x80040205)" in the logs. This error code corresponds to `DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO`, which indicates that the game (Le Mans Ultimate) has stolen Exclusive access to the steering wheel.
We need to explicitly catch this error code to provide a clear, actionable warning to the user.

If our code already had `else if (hr == DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO)` but it printed "Unknown", there are only two possibilities:
1.  **The check wasn't actually in the build** that generated the screenshot (most likely).
2.  **Header Mismatch:** The `dinput.h` header being used defines `DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO` differently (unlikely, but possible in some SDKs).

To be 100% sure we catch it this time, we will add a **redundant check** for the raw hex value `0x80040205` alongside the macro.

Plan: Explicitly Handle Priority Error

Objective: Catch the specific error `0x80040205` (Game stole device) and give the user a clear instruction to disable in-game FFB.

Logic:
1.  Add an `else if` block for `DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO`.
2.  **Safety Net:** OR that condition with `hr == 0x80040205` to guarantee a match even if the macro is wrong.
3.  Set a specific error message instructing the user to disable in-game FFB.


**Implementation Requirements:**

1.  **Update `src/DirectInputFFB.cpp`**:
    *   Inside `UpdateForce`, locate the error handling block (where `DIERR_INPUTLOST` etc. are checked).
    *   Add a specific check for `DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO`.
    *   **CRITICAL:** To ensure we catch it, use this exact condition:
        `else if (hr == DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO || hr == 0x80040205)`
    *   If this error occurs, set the `errorType` string to:
        **"DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO (Game has stolen priority! DISABLE IN-GAME FFB)"**
    *   Ensure `recoverable` remains `true` (we still want to try to get it back after the cooldown).

**Deliverables:**
*   Modified `src/DirectInputFFB.cpp`

**Check-list for completion:**
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB.cpp`: `DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO` is explicitly handled.
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB.cpp`: Raw hex `0x80040205` is included in the check.
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB.cpp`: Error message clearly instructs user to disable in-game FFB.
