**Task: Update Exclusivity State on Priority Loss Errors**

**Reference Documents:**
*   `src\DirectInputFFB.cpp`
*   `src\DirectInputFFB.h`

**Context:**
Currently, the application determines if it is in "Exclusive" or "Shared" mode only once during initialization (`SelectDevice`). However, the OS or the Game can revoke this exclusive status at runtime (e.g., via Alt-Tab or the game stealing focus), resulting in `DIERR_NOTEXCLUSIVEACQUIRED` or `DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO` errors.
When these specific errors occur, we must immediately update the internal state `m_isExclusive` to `false`. This will automatically cause the GUI to switch from the Green "EXCLUSIVE" message to the Yellow "SHARED" warning, correctly alerting the user that the game is interfering.

**Implementation Requirements:**

1.  **Update `src/DirectInputFFB.cpp`**:
    *   Inside the `UpdateForce` function, locate the error handling block where `FormatErrorWithAdvice` is called.
    *   Add logic to check if the error code (`hr`) indicates a loss of exclusivity.
    *   **Condition:** If `hr` is `DIERR_NOTEXCLUSIVEACQUIRED`, `DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO`, or the raw hex `0x80040205`:
        *   Set `m_isExclusive = false;`
    *   *Note:* This ensures the GUI reflects the reality that we no longer hold the exclusive lock.

**Deliverables:**
*   Modified `src/DirectInputFFB.cpp`

**Check-list for completion:**
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB.cpp`: `m_isExclusive` is set to `false` when priority/exclusivity errors are detected.
