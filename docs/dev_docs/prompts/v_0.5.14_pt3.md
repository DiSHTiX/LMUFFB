**Task: Refactor DirectInput Error Logging to use Helper Function**

**Reference Documents:**
*   `src\DirectInputFFB.cpp`

**Context:**
We have added a helper function `const char* GetDirectInputErrorString(HRESULT hr)` to the codebase (likely at the top of `DirectInputFFB.cpp` or in a header).
We want to replace the manual `if/else if` block that assigns `errorType` strings with a call to this function to provide verbose, official Microsoft descriptions for all errors.
**However**, for the specific case of `DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO` (and `DIERR_NOTEXCLUSIVEACQUIRED`), we **must** preserve the custom advice telling the user to disable in-game FFB, as the standard Microsoft description ("Another application has a higher priority level...") is too vague for users to know how to fix it.

**Implementation Requirements:**

1.  **Update `src/DirectInputFFB.cpp`**:
    *   Inside `UpdateForce`, locate the `if (FAILED(hr))` block.
    *   **Replace** the existing chain of `if (hr == DIERR_INPUTLOST) ... else if ...` with logic that calls `GetDirectInputErrorString(hr)`.
    *   **Append Custom Advice:** If `hr` is `DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO` or `DIERR_NOTEXCLUSIVEACQUIRED` (or `0x80040205`), append the string: **" [CRITICAL: Game has stolen priority! DISABLE IN-GAME FFB]"** to the error description.
    *   Update the `std::cerr` logging line to print this detailed message.

**Deliverables:**
*   Modified `src/DirectInputFFB.cpp`

**Check-list for completion:**
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB.cpp`: Uses `GetDirectInputErrorString(hr)` for the base error message.
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB.cpp`: Appends "DISABLE IN-GAME FFB" advice specifically for priority/exclusive errors.
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB.cpp`: Manual `if/else if` string mapping block is removed.
