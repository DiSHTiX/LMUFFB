**Task: Implement Smart Recovery Cool-down for DirectInput**

**Reference Documents:**
*   `docs\dev_docs\improve no FFB error handling if not on top_pt2.md`
*   `src\DirectInputFFB.cpp`

**Context:**
We recently enabled aggressive error recovery for DirectInput errors. However, if the game locks the device in Exclusive Mode, our app currently tries to re-acquire the device every single frame (400Hz). This causes high CPU usage and potential stuttering ("Tug of War").
We need to throttle these recovery attempts so they happen at most once every 2 seconds.

**Implementation Requirements:**

1.  **Update `src/DirectInputFFB.cpp`**:
    *   Inside `UpdateForce`, locate the error handling block where `recoverable` is checked.
    *   Introduce a **Cool-down Timer**:
        *   Define `const DWORD RECOVERY_COOLDOWN_MS = 2000;`.
        *   Use a `static DWORD lastRecoveryAttempt = 0;` to track state.
    *   **Wrap the Recovery Logic:**
        *   Only enter the `if (recoverable)` block (or the `Acquire` call inside it) if `GetTickCount() - lastRecoveryAttempt > RECOVERY_COOLDOWN_MS`.
    *   **Update Timer:**
        *   Inside the conditional block, update `lastRecoveryAttempt = GetTickCount();` *before* attempting to acquire.
    *   **Preserve Critical Logic:**
        *   **CRITICAL:** Ensure the `m_pEffect->Start(1, 0)` call is **PRESERVED** inside the successful recovery block. This is essential to restart the FFB motor after a focus loss.
    *   **Log Update:**
        *   If recovery is skipped due to cooldown, do *not* log anything (to keep the console clean).
        *   If recovery is attempted, ensure the existing success logs are preserved.

2.  **Documentation**:
    *   Update `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect that the connection recovery is now "Throttled" or "Smart" to prevent performance issues.

**Deliverables:**
*   Modified `src/DirectInputFFB.cpp`
*   Updated `CHANGELOG.md`

**Check-list for completion:**
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB.cpp`: Added `RECOVERY_COOLDOWN_MS` constant.
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB.cpp`: Added `lastRecoveryAttempt` static variable.
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB.cpp`: Recovery attempts are gated by the 2-second timer.
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB.cpp`: `m_pEffect->Start(1, 0)` is present in the recovery block.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md`: Updated.
