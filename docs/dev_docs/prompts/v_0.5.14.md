**Task: Explicitly Handle DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO (0x80040205)**

**Reference Documents:**
*   `src\DirectInputFFB.cpp`

**Context:**
Users are reporting "Unknown Error (0x80040205)" in the logs. This error code corresponds to `DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO`, which indicates that the game (Le Mans Ultimate) has stolen Exclusive access to the steering wheel.
Currently, the app treats this as a generic error. We need to explicitly catch this error code to provide a clear, actionable warning to the user, telling them to disable FFB inside the game settings.

**Implementation Requirements:**

1.  **Update `src/DirectInputFFB.cpp`**:
    *   Inside `UpdateForce`, in the error handling block:
    *   Add a specific check for `hr == DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO`.
    *   If this error occurs, set the `errorType` string to:
        **"DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO (Game has stolen priority! DISABLE IN-GAME FFB)"**
    *   Ensure `recoverable` remains `true` (we still want to try to get it back after the cooldown).

**Deliverables:**
*   Modified `src/DirectInputFFB.cpp`

**Check-list for completion:**
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB.cpp`: `DIERR_OTHERAPPHASPRIO` is explicitly handled.
- [ ] `DirectInputFFB.cpp`: Error message clearly instructs user to disable in-game FFB.
