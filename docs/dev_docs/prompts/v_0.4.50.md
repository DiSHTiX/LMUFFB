**Task: Implement FFB Signal Gain Compensation ("Decoupling")**

**Reference Documents:**
*   `docs\dev_docs\Gain Compensation implementation plan.md` (Contains the detailed logic, slider classification, and code snippets)
*   `FFBEngine.h`
*   `src\GuiLayer.cpp`

**Context:**
Currently, the application calculates forces in absolute Newton-meters (Nm). These forces are normalized by the user's `Max Torque Ref` setting.
*   **Problem:** If a user increases `Max Torque Ref` (e.g., to 100 Nm for a T300 wheel to avoid clipping), the relative strength of fixed-force effects (like Road Texture or Slide) drops to near zero (e.g., 2 Nm / 100 Nm = 2%).
*   **Goal:** Implement "Gain Compensation". When `Max Torque Ref` increases, we must automatically scale up the "Generator" effects so they maintain their perceived intensity relative to the full signal range.

**Implementation Requirements:**

1.  **Physics Engine (`FFBEngine.h`)**:
    *   In `calculate_force`, compute `double decoupling_scale = (double)m_max_torque_ref / 20.0;` (Clamped to min 0.1).
    *   Apply this scale factor to all **Generator** effects:
        *   SoP Base Force, Rear Align Torque, Yaw Kick, Gyro Damping.
        *   Lockup, Spin, Slide Texture, Road Texture, Scrub Drag, Bottoming.
    *   **Do NOT** apply it to **Modifier** effects (Understeer Effect, Oversteer Boost), as they are ratios/multipliers that inherit scaling naturally.

2.  **GUI Layer (`src/GuiLayer.cpp`)**:
    *   Update `DrawTuningWindow` to use the new slider ranges defined in the Implementation Plan (mostly `0.0` to `2.0`).
    *   Implement a helper lambda `FormatDecoupled(float val, float base_nm)` that calculates the estimated Nm output based on the current `Max Torque Ref` and formats the slider text as `"%.0f%% (~%.1f Nm)"`.
    *   Apply this formatting to all decoupled sliders so users see the physical force they are configuring.
    *   Update "Understeer Effect" to display as `0% - 100%` (mapped from internal 0-50).

3.  **Testing (`tests/test_ffb_engine.cpp`)**:
    *   Add a new test case: `test_gain_compensation()`.
    *   **Logic:**
        1.  Configure `Max Torque Ref = 20.0`. Enable an effect (e.g., Slide Texture). Record the normalized output.
        2.  Configure `Max Torque Ref = 40.0`. Record the normalized output.
    *   **Assertion:** The normalized output should be **identical** (or very close).
        *   *Math:* (Force * 1.0) / 20.0 == (Force * 2.0) / 40.0.
    *   This proves that the effect intensity is "decoupled" from the calibration scale.

**Deliverables:**
*   Modified `FFBEngine.h`
*   Modified `src/GuiLayer.cpp`
*   Modified `tests/test_ffb_engine.cpp` with extensive new tests.
*   Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION`.

**Check-list for completion:**
- [ ] `decoupling_scale` implemented in `FFBEngine.h` and applied to all Generators.
- [ ] Modifiers (Understeer/Boost) are excluded from scaling.
- [ ] GUI sliders updated to show Dynamic Nm values.
- [ ] `test_gain_compensation` passes, verifying consistent output ratio across different Torque Refs.
- [ ] All existing tests pass (Regression check).
