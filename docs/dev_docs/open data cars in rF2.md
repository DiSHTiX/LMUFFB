* Chevrolet Corvette C6.R GT2 (2009): An ISI-era release. Physics files are accessible, and mTireLoad is fully visible in telemetry.
* Nissan GT500 (2013) & 370Z: While technically Super GT, the GT500 uses high-downforce physics that output full load data.
* Chevrolet Camaro GT3 (2012): An early GT3 implementation by ISI. Useful for comparing "Legacy" GT3 physics with the modern, encrypted GT3 DLC.
