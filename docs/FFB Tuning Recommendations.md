### Rear Align Torque, Lateral G Boost (Slide), and Yaw Kick

To achieve a natural blend, users should:

1.  **Start with "Rear Align Torque" first:** Tune this until the counter-steering pull feels clear and responsive.
2.  **Then add "Lateral G Boost (Slide)":** Increase this gradually to add the sensation of chassis momentum without making the wheel too heavy to turn.
3.  **Use "Yaw Kick" for early warning:** This should be a sharp, short impulse at the very start of the slide.
4.  **Monitor "Clipping":** If the total force is clipping, reduce `Master Gain` or increase `Max Torque Ref` to ensure all these distinct forces have headroom.

By understanding these individual roles and their combined effect, the user can tune a highly informative and intuitive oversteer experience.
